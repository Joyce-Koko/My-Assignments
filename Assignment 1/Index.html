    <!-- Reasons for Joining -->
    <section id="reasons">
      <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been fascinated by technology and its transformative power
        to solve problems and create new opportunities. For a long time, I
        envisioned myself working in a tech-related field, but I wasn't sure how
        to transition from my background in Microbiology. When I discovered
        AltSchool Africa, it felt like the perfect gateway to turn my passion
        for tech into a reality. AltSchool's hands-on approach, coupled with its
        focus on real-world applications, made it stand out as the ideal
        platform for me to dive into Cloud Engineering. I was drawn to the
        program's emphasis on equipping students with practical skills and its
        strong support for learners from diverse academic backgrounds. By
        joining this program, I am taking a bold step toward building a career
        in technology, one that aligns with my vision of using innovation to
        make a positive impact.
